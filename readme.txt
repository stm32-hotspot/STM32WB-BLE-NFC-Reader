The FP-SNS-MOTENVWB1 is an STM32Cube function pack for STM32WB
with BLE connectivity and environmental and motion sensors.
The software runs on the STM32WB and includes the necessary
drivers to recognize the devices on the STM32WB board
and X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 expansion board. 
The software comes with a sample implementation available for
X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 connected to a P-NUCLEO-WB55.

For the content of this package, the development toolchains and compilers
to use and the supported devices and evaluation boards, refer to the
Release Notes in the root directory of this package.

The simplest way to start using this expansion software is to run the
sample applications in Projects\P-NUCLEO-WB55.Nucleo\Applications.
The readme.txt included in the Applications folder provides the
description of the application and the instructions on how to run it.
