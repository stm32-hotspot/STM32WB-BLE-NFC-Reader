Application Description 

 This firmware package includes Components Device Drivers, Board Support Package
 and example application for the following STMicroelectronics elements:
 - P-NUCLEO-WB55RG Nucleo-68 board with STM32WB55 MCU supporting Bluetoothâ„¢ 5 and 802.15.4 connectivity
 - X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 Expansion board for six MEMS sensor devices:
       HTS221, LIS2DW12, LIS2MDL, LPS22HH, LSM5DSO
 - MotionFX (iNEMOEngine PRO) suite uses advanced algorithms to integrate outputs
 from multiple MEMS sensors in a smartway, independent of environmental conditions,
 to reach optimal performance. Real-time motion-sensor data fusion is set to significantly
 improve the user experience, increasing accuracy, resolution, stability and response time.
 - MotionAR (iNEMOEngine PRO) software provides real-time activity recognition data
 using MEMS accelerometer sensor
 - MotionCP (iNEMOEngine PRO) software provides carry Position recognition data
 using MEMS accelerometer sensor
 - MotionGR (iNEMOEngine PRO) software provides Gesture recognition data
 using MEMS accelerometer sensor
 - MotionPM (iNEMOEngine PRO) software provides Pedometer recognition data
 using MEMS accelerometer sensor
 - MotionID (iNEMOEngine PRO) software provides real-time Motion Intensity recognition data
 using MEMS accelerometer sensor
 - X-NUCLEO-NFC06A1 Expansion board for NFC card reader expansion board is based on the ST25R3916 device

 The Example application initializes all the Components and Library creating 3 Custom Bluetooth services:
 - The first service exposes all the HW characteristics related to MEMS sensor devices: Temperature, Humidity,
 Pressure, Magnetometer, Gyroscope and Accelerometer, LED status
 - The second service exposes the SW characteristic: the quaternions generated by the MotionFX library 
 in short precision, the activity recognized using the MotionAR algorithm, the carry position
 recognized using the MotionCP algorithm, the Gesture recognized using the MotionGR algorithm,
 the Motion Intensity recognized using the MotionID algorithm and the Steps and frequency with MotionPM algorithm
 - The third Service is used for configuration purpose

 The Example is based on the FP-SNS-MOTENVWB1 function pack and includes the driver for the ST25R3916 device (NFC reader) to be able to read a dynamic tag such as the ST25DV64K.  
 
 For debug purposes the user can launch a terminal application and set the UART port to 115200 bps, 8 bit, No Parity,
 1 stop bit.

Inside the Binary Directory there are the following binaries:
Binary/
+-- MOTENV1_IKS01A3_WB55RG.bin
 
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on a X-NUCLEO-NFC06A1 Expansion board and a X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 Sensor expansion board attached to P-NUCLEO-WB55RG.Nucleo board.
    
  - This example must be used with the ST BLE Sensor Android/iOS application available on Play/iTunes store,
    in order to read the sent information by Bluetooth Low Energy protocol.

@par STM32Cube packages:
  - STM32ubeWB V1.2.0
@par X-CUBE packages:
  - X-CUBE-MEMS1 V6.2.0

@par How to use it ? 

This package contains projects for 2 IDEs viz. IAR and CubeIDE. 
In order to make the  program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.

For IAR:
 - Open IAR toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V8.32.3).
 - Open the IAR project EWARM\Project.eww
 - Rebuild all files.
 
For CubeIDE:
 - Open CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with CubeIDE Version 1.0.1).
 - Set the default workspace proposed by the IDE (please be sure that there are not spaces in the workspace path).
 - Press "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace"; press "Browse" in the "Select root directory" and choose the path where the CubeIDE
 project is located (it should be CubeIDE\MOTENV1_IKS01A3_WB55RG). 
 - Rebuild all files.

@par CubeMX
The hardware and software configuration, and the projects (for EWARM and CubeIDE toolchains) generation have been done with STM32CubeMX.
The project folder also includes the MOTENV1_IKS01A3_WB55RG.ioc file to be opened with STM32CubeMX V5.2.0 or higher allowing the user to check and or/change system configuration.
Notice that when regenerating the projects with CubeMX you should have the .extSettings file specifying additional project settings at the same level of the MOTENV1_IKS01A3_WB55RG.ioc file
Since Middleware libraries providing MEMS features come with different build for different toolchains, you need to use specific .extSetting file.

For IAR:
 - .extSettings is included in extSettings/EWARM folder

For CubeIDE:
 - .extSettings is included in extSettings/CubeIDE folder
